# gobucks
Natalie and Vlad learn Go.

## How To Use
So this isn't actually user-friendly, it's more like an excuse to encounter as many Go concepts as we can.

* `go build`
* `./GobucksConcurrent <filepath>`

The file should look something like
```
gamble 10 nat
gamble 20 vlad
gamble 30 nat
gamble 10 justin
gamble 12 vlad
gamble 10 nat
gamble 10 nat
gamble 10 nat
```
